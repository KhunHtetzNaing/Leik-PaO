## Installation

Install the latest version from [pub](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/install).

## Getting started

Import the following package.

```dart
import 'package:syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/pdfviewer.dart';
```

## Add PDF Viewer to the widget tree

Add the **SfPdfViewer** widget as a child of any widget. Here, the **SfPdfViewer** widget is added as a child of the **Container** widget.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: Container(
          child: SfPdfViewer.network(
              'https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/PDFViewer/flutter-succinctly.pdf')));
}
```

### Web integration

We have used [PdfJs](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.4.456/pdf.min.js) for rendering the PDF page as an image on the web platform, so the script file must be referred to in your `web/index.html` file.

On your `web/index.html` file, add the following `script` tags, somewhere in the `body` of the document:

```html
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.11.338/pdf.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = "//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.11.338/pdf.worker.min.js";
</script>
```

## Load PDF document from the Asset

The [SfPdfViewer.asset](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/latest/pdfviewer/SfPdfViewer/SfPdfViewer.asset.html) creates a widget that displays the PDF document obtained from an [AssetBundle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/AssetBundle-class.html).

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: SfPdfViewer.asset(
              'assets/flutter-succinctly.pdf'));
}
```

## Load PDF document from the Network

The [SfPdfViewer.network](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/latest/pdfviewer/SfPdfViewer/SfPdfViewer.network.html) creates a widget that displays the PDF document obtained from a URL.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: SfPdfViewer.network(
              'https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/PDFViewer/flutter-succinctly.pdf'));
}
```

## Load PDF document from the File

The [SfPdfViewer.file](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/latest/pdfviewer/SfPdfViewer/SfPdfViewer.file.html) creates a widget that displays the PDF document obtained from a [File](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-io/File-class.html).

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: SfPdfViewer.file(
              File('storage/emulated/0/Download/flutter-succinctly.pdf')));
}
```

## Load PDF document from the Memory

The [SfPdfViewer.memory](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/latest/pdfviewer/SfPdfViewer/SfPdfViewer.memory.html) creates a widget that displays the PDF document obtained from the [Uint8List](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-typed_data/Uint8List-class.html).

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: SfPdfViewer.memory(
              bytes));
}
```

## Load encrypted PDF document

Encrypted or password-protected document can be loaded in the **SfPdfViewer** widget by specifying the password in [password](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer/latest/pdfviewer/SfPdfViewer/password.html) property.

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
      body: Container(
          child: SfPdfViewer.network(
              'https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/PDFViewer/encrypted.pdf',
              password: 'syncfusion')));
}
```
